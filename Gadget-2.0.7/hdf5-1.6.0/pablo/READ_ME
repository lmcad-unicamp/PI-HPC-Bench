To build the Pablo Instrumented version of the HDF 5 library

1) Configure the system as normal from the parent directory

2) Make the normal HDF 5 library 

3) set the environment variable PABLO_TRACELIB to the path of the directory
   continaining the Pablo TraceLibrary.  This directory should contain the
   lib and include directories as subdirectories
 
4) If building to instrument MPI programs, uncomment the line beginning
   PABLO_MPI_FLAGS.  In this case, the Pablo TraceLibrary should be built
   to trace the MPI-I/O calls.

5) If you are going to link with the Pablo TraceLibraries, issue the 
   make or make install commands
   If you are going to link with the Pablo PCF, issue one of the commands
   make PABLO_BLD=PCF   or  make PABLO_BLD=PCF install
