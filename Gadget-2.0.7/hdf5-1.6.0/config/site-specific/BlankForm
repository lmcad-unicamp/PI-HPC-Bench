# Specifying Extra Library Directories
# ------------------------------------
#
# The user should be able to specify extra library directories for the
# LDFLAGS macro. The compiler may not be set up to recognize those
# directories as valid library directories

# Specifying Extra Include Directories
# ------------------------------------
#
# The user should be able to specify extra include directories for the
# CPPFLAGS macro. The compiler may not be set up to recognize those
# directories as valid include directories

if test -f "/usr/ncsa/include"; then
   CPPFLAGS="/usr/ncsa/include"
