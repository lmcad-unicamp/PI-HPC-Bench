$h5diff file1.h5 file2.h5 -d 0 g1/dset3 g1/dset4
<-d 0> is not a valid option
Usage: h5diff file1 file2 [OPTIONS] [obj1[obj2]] 

file1             File name of the first HDF5 file
file2             File name of the second HDF5 file
[obj1]            Name of an HDF5 object, in absolute path
[obj2]            Name of an HDF5 object, in absolute path
[OPTIONS] are:
[-h]              Print out this information
[-r]              Print only what objects differ, not the differences
[-n count]        Print difference up to count number
[-d delta]        Print difference when it is greater than limit delta
[-p relative]     Print difference when it is greater than a relative limit

Items in [] are optional
[obj1] and [obj2] are HDF5 objects (datasets, groups or datatypes)
The 'count' value must be a positive integer
The 'delta' and 'relative' values must be positive numbers
The -d compare criteria is |a - b| > delta
The -p compare criteria is |1 - b/a| > relative

Examples:

1) h5diff file1 file2 /a/b /a/c

   Compares object '/a/b' in file1 with '/a/c' in file2

2) h5diff file1 file2 /a/b

   Compares object '/a/b' in both files

3) h5diff file1 file2

   Compares all objects in both files
