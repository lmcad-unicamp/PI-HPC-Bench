===============================================================================
     HDF5 C++ Library Build and Testing Instructions for Windows NT/98
     with Microsoft Visual C++ V 6.0
===============================================================================

     This is applicable to the development version of HDF5 libraries.

Preconditions
-------------

    1. These instructions are for users who wish to build the C and 
       C++ libraries.  If you are interested only in the C library, 
       refer to INSTAll_Windows.txt or INSTAll_codewarrior.txt.

    2. MicroSoft Developer Studio,Visual C++ 6.0 and WinZip must be 
       installed prior to building the HDF5 library.

    3. Set up a directory structure to unpack the library.
      For example:

            c:\                         (any drive of your choice)
           MyHDFstuff\                  (any folder name)

    4. Download the hdf5xxx distribution archive and use WinZip to 
       extract the hdf5 package into c:\MyHDFstuff.  This creates a 
       directory called 'hdf5xxx' under MyHDFstuff which contains 
       several files and directories. Rename "hdf5xxx" to "hdf5". 

    5. HDF5 uses the zlib library, which is distributed with the HDF5 
       Windows source code.  


Building the HDF5 C and C++ libraries (both static and shared)
-------------------------------------

    1. Unpack all.zip, found in the c:\MyHDFstuff\hdf5\windows directory, 
       into c:\MyHDFstuff.

    2. Go to the hdf5\proj\ directory and double-click on the file all.dsw. 
       This will invoke MS VC++.
     
    3. Make sure that "all" is "Set as Active Project" by selecting
       "Project"/"Set Active Project", or right-clicking on "all" then
       selecting "Set as Active Project."

    4. Select "Project"/"Dependencies", then enable the desired projects:

	hdf5_cpp: to build the C++ API static library
	dsets_cpp: to build the test dsets.cpp, must also select hdf5_cpp
	testhdf5_cpp: to build the test testhdf5.cpp, must also select hdf5_cpp

	hdf5_cppdll: to build the C++ API dynamic-linked library
        dsets_cppdll: to build the DLL dsets test, must also select hdf5_cppdll
        testhdf5_cppdll: to build the DLL testhdf5 test, must also select
                        hdf5_cppdll

    5. Select "Build", then select "Set Active Configuration".

            "all -- Win32 Debug" to build debug versions of
                single-threaded static libraries, debug multithreaded DLLs,
                and tests.

            "all -- Win32 Release" to build release versions of
                single-threaded static libraries, multithreaded DLLs,
                and tests.

    NOTE: "all" is a dummy target, "all.exe" is never created.

    When the debug or release build is completed, the directories 
    listed below will contain the following files:

           hdf5\proj\hdf5\debug - 
           hdf5\proj\hdf5\release - 
               hdf5.lib- the C hdf5 static library

           hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\debug - 
               hdf5ddll.dll- the C hdf5 library
               hdf5ddll.lib- the dll export library                  

           hdf5\proj\hdf5dll\release - 
               hdf5dll.dll- the C hdf5 library
               hdf5dll.lib- the dll export library

           hdf5\proj\hdf5_cpp\debug - 
           hdf5\proj\hdf5_cpp\release - 
               hdf5_cpp.lib- the hdf5 C++ API static library

           hdf5\proj\hdf5_cppdll\debug - 
               hdf5_cppddll.dll- the hdf5 C++ API dll library
               hdf5_cppddll.lib- the C++ API dll export library                  
           hdf5\proj\hdf5_cppdll\release - 
               hdf5_cppdll.dll- the hdf5 C++ API dll library
               hdf5_cppdll.lib- the C++ API dll export library


Testing libraries and tools
---------------------------

    1. See the file INSTALL_Windows.txt (STEP 2) for instruction on 
       testing the C HDF5 library and non-hdf4-related tools.

    2. To test C++ HDF5 Library, you first need to copy the appropriate
       DLL files to the Windows system directory.

         The system directory can usually be found under the path
                C:\WINNT\system or C:\WINDOWS\system

       You can now run hdf5cpptest.bat in the hdf5\c++\test directory 
       at the command prompt as below:

	hdf5cpptest release
	hdf5cpptest release dll
	hdf5cpptest debug
	hdf5cpptest debug dll
